Goal 1 - generate a slug for each post

gatsby.md --> gatsby --> /gatsby or /blog/gatsby

need slug to set up correct endpoint for where the post will be accessible 


Goal 2 - generate the blog post page template (react component)

Goal 3 - combine 1 and 2, generate a new page for each post

------
gatsby-node.js file 
- gives access to gatsby node api
- list of apis on gatsby website
- onCreateNode 
    - called when a new node is created. 
    - allows us to to attach some new data to the individual node, we will attach the slug so we have access to the slug in entire project
    - node is nothing more than data structure for storing data 
        - we grabbed data from the node in graphql playground

COMPLETED
